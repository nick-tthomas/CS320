1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

You can ensure that a code, program, or software is by adhering to the specified security standards, and industry best practices.

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I try to analyze all the upfront information the user has provided and come up with a plan for how I'm going to incorporate it into a project. This is usally done via either some kind of diagram or psuedocode.

3. How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by first looking at the requirements. The more upfront work you can do before you even type a line of code the better you can set yourself up for success.
